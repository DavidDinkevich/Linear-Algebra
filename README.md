# Linear-Algebra

Inspired by my Linear Algebra class, this is a console application that allows the user to perform various operations on vectors and matrices, including:
<ul>
<li>Graham-Schmidt algorithm for computing orthonormal bases</li>
<li>Computing the Eigenvalues of a matrix using the QR decomposition algorithm</li>
<li>Computing the Row Echelon Form (REF) of a matrix</li>
<li>Inverting matrices and computing the determinant and adjoint</li>
</ul>
